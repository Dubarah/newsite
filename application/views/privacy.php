                      <h3>  Dubarah Privacy policy Latest update May 25th, 2018 in compliance to GDPR update.</h3><br>


<p>Preamble www.Dubarah.com (the 'Website ' 'Dubarah') is owned and operated by Dubarah Inc. and is a subscription based service that allows users to post services in regards to a variety of tasks, skills and any needs.<br>


The creator of an account in Dubarah is the User. We collect information about the User and any members that he or she invites to join the Dubarah.<br>


We are committed to providing all our Users with exceptional service. As providing this service involves the collection, use, storage and disclosure of some personal information about you (our User), protecting your personal information is one of our highest priorities. We will inform you of why and how we collect, use and disclose your personal information, and obtain your consent where required. This Privacy Policy outlines the principles and practices we will follow in protecting your personal information.<br> Our privacy commitment includes ensuring the accuracy, confidentiality, and security of your personal information and allowing you to request access to, and correction of, your personal information.


Please contact us at: website@dubarah.com if you have any questions regarding our privacy policy or practices, or require any additional information on any of the below topics. This Policy applies to all sites, mobile applications, and other online services (collectively, Platform) made available by Dubarah. It does not apply to other websites to which we link. You agree that your use of the Website signifies your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website.<br>


Undefined capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions as set forth in our Terms of Use. By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to this Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM. KEY TERMS Please review the Key Terms section in the Terms of Use.<br>

<br>
1) HOW YOU PROVIDE YOUR CONSENT We will obtain your consent to collect, use or disclose personal information (except where, as noted below, we are authorized to do so without consent). You can provide your consent electronically or it can be implied where the purpose for collecting, using or disclosing the personal information would be considered obvious and you voluntarily provide personal information for that purpose. Examples of this are when you post files to your account. We support audio files, embedded Video for YouTube or Vimeo, PDF's, Office documents and photos. Please note that any member who has account access can view or download those files. Consent may also be implied where you are given notice of your personal information being used for mail-outs, the marketing of new services or products, fundraising, and you do not opt-out. Subject to certain exceptions (listed below), you can withhold or withdraw your consent for MyBand.IO to use your personal information in certain ways.

Your decision to withhold or withdraw your consent to certain uses of personal information may restrict our ability to provide a particular service or product. If so, we will explain the situation to assist you in making a decision. There are special circumstances where we may collect, use or disclose some of your personal information without your knowledge or consent, when we are permitted or required by law. A full listing of such circumstances can be found in section 7 (Collection without knowledge or consent) of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c. 5 ['PIPEDA'].


2) INFORMATION WE COLLECT How we collect and store information depends on how you access and use the Platform. We collect two types of information from you: i) information that you voluntarily provide to us (e.g. through a voluntary registration process, sign-ups or emails); and ii) information that is collected automatically when using the Site (e.g. tracking cookies): Information You Provide Directly to Us In order to fully access this Site, you must first complete the registration process, during which we will collect personal information about you, such as: When you register for an Account; When you participate in polls or surveys; When you enroll for electronic newsletters; When you request a quote or other information; When you submit a quote; When you make a purchase; When you fill out any forms; When you enter a sweepstakes or contest, or register for a promotion; When you transmit User Content; When you download or use one of our mobile applications; or When you otherwise communicate with us or other users through the Platform. This list is illustrative, not exhaustive; the Privacy Policy applies to all use of the Platform. The information you provide directly to us may concern you or others and may include, but is not limited to: (a) name; (b) zip code; (c) email address; (d) home or business telephone number; (e) home, business or mailing address; (f) demographic information (e.g., gender, age, political preference, education, race or ethnic origin, and other information relevant to user surveys and/or offers); (g) date of birth; (h) insurance information; (i) photographs; (j) information about your project, request or need; (k) video or audio files; and/or (l) in certain circumstances, payment and/or identity verification information. It may also include information specific to services you are requesting or offering through the Platform, such as a business name, service description, qualifications and credentials. You are not required to provide us with such information, but certain features of the Platform may not be accessible or available, absent the provision of the requested information. Information from Affiliates, Social Networking Sites, and other Non-affiliated Third Parties We may collect information about you or others through Dubarah affiliates or through non-affiliated third parties. For example, you may be able to access the Platform through a social networking account, such as Facebook. If you access the Platform through your Facebook account, you may allow us to have access to certain information in your Facebook profile. This may include your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, location, date of birth, email address, photos, videos, people you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or 'likes ' and future information that could help us improve your experience on Dubarah website. Social networking sites, such as Facebook, have their own policies for handling your information. For a description of how these sites may use and disclose your information including any information you make public, please consult the sites' privacy policies. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the personal information it collects about you. We may also collect information about you or others through non-affiliated third parties. For example, to the extent permitted by law, we may, in our sole discretion, ask for and collect supplemental information from third parties, such as information about your credit from a credit bureau, or information to verify your identity or trustworthiness, or for other fraud or safety protection purposes. We may combine information that we collect from you through the Platform with information that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other products or services we provide. Information That is Passively or Automatically Collected Device/Usage Information. We and our third-party service providers, which include ad networks and analytics companies including Crashalytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Platform. As described further below, we may collect and analyze information including but not limited to (a) browser type; (b) ISP or operating system; (c) domain name; (d) access time; (e) referring or exit pages; (f) page views; (g) IP address; (h) unique device identifiers (e.g. IMIE); and (i) the type of device that you use. We may also track how frequently you access or use the Platform. We use this information (including the information collected by our third-party service providers) for Platform analytics (including to determine which portions of the Platform are used most frequently and what our users like/do not like), to assist in determining relevant advertising (both on and off the Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as otherwise described in this Policy. Location Information. When you use the Platform, we may collect general location information (such as IP address). If you install our mobile app, we may ask you to grant us access to your mobile device's geolocation data. If you grant such permission, we may collect information about your precise geolocation, and we may use that information to improve the Platform, including providing you with location-based features (e.g. for identification of Services available near you). To deliver customized content and advertising, we may share your location information with our agents, vendors, or advertisers. If you access the Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer's instructions for further details. If you disable certain functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the Platform. Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies. We and our third-party service providers may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help us better understand user behaviour, personalize preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Platform. These technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Platform to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Platform usage. We also use certain of these technologies to deliver advertisements through the Platform that may interest you. We or our third-party service providers also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded. We may also use local shared objects (also known as Flash cookies) to assist in delivering special content, such as video clips or animation. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are not managed through your web browser. To learn more about how to manage Flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Platform, because it may not function properly. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not affect flash cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.

Unless otherwise described in this Policy, we may also share the information that we collect from you through the Platform as follows: Affiliates. We may share your information with any Dubarah affiliates, such as with our parent, subsidiaries, and divisions Consent. We may disclose your information to nonaffiliated third parties based on your consent to do so.

These third parties provide a variety of services to us including without limitation billing, sales, marketing, advertising, market research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, identity verification, fraud and safety protection and legal services.

Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets. In such transactions or where there is any change of control of Dubarah, user information may be among the transferred assets. App Store Providers. We may provide your identity and mobile device identifier to third-party app store providers (for example, the Apple App Store) to allow you to download our mobile apps. Please be advised that some information you provide will be publicly accessible. For instance, registration for an Account requires that you provide us with your name. If you register through Facebook, the Platform will use the name associated with your Facebook account. Your name (full name, or in some instances, your first name and last initial) may be visible to other users. Depending on the circumstances, your name may be attached to your Content or information, such as scheduling of Services, service requests, reviews, participating in discussions or forums, messaging, and profile information. Certain other people, including other users with whom you have interacted via the Platform, will see information about you that is attached to your name. For example but without limitation, if you are a Client Member seeking Services, the description you provide of your desired services will be shown to some Dubarah 's registered in the relevant category along with your name. Thus, other users may be able to personally identify you based on Content you provide. We invite you to post Content on or through our Platform, including your comments, feedback, pictures, and any other information. However, please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.

<br>
5) ONLINE ANALYTICS AND TAILORED ADVERTISING Analytics We may use third-party web analytics services on the Platform, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology described in the Information That Is Passively or Automatically Collected section above to help us analyze how users use the Platform, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Platform. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on. Tailored Advertising Third parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed via the Platform may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Platform in order to (a) inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (b) report how our marketing content impressions, other uses of marketing services, and interactions with these marketing impressions and marketing services are related to visits to our websites. We also allow other third parties(e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Crashlytics, Facebook and others) to serve tailored marketing to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed, non-human readable form. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada Opt-Out Tool to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Platform, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on the DAAC's website accessible by the above link. When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertising content. Each operating system, iOS for Apple devices, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application marketing content. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertising. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.

<br>
6) SECURITY We are committed to ensuring the security of personal information we receive from you, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, or disposal or similar risks.

Dubarah may use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. Disclaimer to Security.

Dubarah is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen, compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized password activity.
<br>
7) LINKS TO EXTERNAL PLATFORMS The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over which Dubarah does not have any control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Dubarah of those external websites. You acknowledge that Dubarah is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Dubarah is not responsible for the content of such external websites or the protection and privacy of information you provide while visiting such external websites.

<br>

You must promptly update your Account information if it changes or is inaccurate. Upon your request, we will close your Account and remove your profile information from view as soon as reasonably possible. We may retain information from closed Accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any user, enforce our Terms of Use, and/or for any other purposes otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our sole discretion. You should understand, however, that once you transmit User Content through the Platform, you may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have deleted or removed your Account, you agree that Dubarah will not be responsible to you for retaining information related to your Account.

<br>

<br>
12) CONSENT TO TRANSFER Our computer systems are currently based in Canada, so your personal data will be processed by us in Canada, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create an Account with the Platform as a visitor from outside Canada, by using the Platform, you agree to this Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to Canada, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Policy.
<br>

Dubarah may store the email addresses you provide so that the respondents may be added to your account, to confirm orders/purchases and also to send reminders of the invitations. Dubarah does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. Recipients of invitations may contact Dubarah to request removal of their information from our database.
